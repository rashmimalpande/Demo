## A sample theme in WordPress 

This is a simple theme home page made in WordPress. The header logo, footer logo and footer copyright text can be changed through customizer settings.
There are three menus on the home page - header, footer and one in body. The body has a list where you hover over the title to see its subpages.

The slider displays latest 5 posts. The slider is created using [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/). 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling & CSS   
[Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) required for Owl Carousel to animate the slider.  
[wp_bootstrap_navwalker](https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker) - to make the header menu responsive with bootstrap classes.

The top footer consists of 4 widgets. There are two custom widgets. First is a news widget which displays posts of category 'News'. Second is a social widget to add social media links.  
The bottom footer has a menu, logo and copyright text.
