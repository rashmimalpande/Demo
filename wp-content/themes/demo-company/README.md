## A sample theme in WordPress 

This is a simple theme home page made in WordPress. The header logo, footer logo and footer copyright text can be changed through customizer settings.
There are three menus on the home page - header, footer and one in body. The body has a list where you hover over the title to see its subpages.

The slider displays latest 5 posts. The slider is created using Owl Carousel.  

The top footer consists of 4 widgets. There are two custom widgets. First is a news widget which displays posts of category 'News'. Second is a social widget to add social media links.
